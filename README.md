# Emotion Detector
The model aims to take in video as an input and give the statistics for each emotion throughout the video. Uses the FER-2013 dataset for training and employs CNN layers to train the model.

Also employs backend to send the results on mail, although the video after being uploaded is stored on the local engine and this requires setting up gmail id and password to send the mail to the recipient
